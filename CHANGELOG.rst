4.0.0 (2022-05-29)
------------------

* Drop support for the ``pydev`` formatter. Now if the project does not contain a ``[tool.black]`` section, ``esss-fix-format``
  will issue an error.

3.2.0 (2021-01-12)
------------------

* Add support to .cu (CUDA) files.
* When running ``black`` on a large number of files, pass all files at once on Linux. Previously ``esss_fix_format`` would
  pass files in chunks due to a limitation in Windows command-line size, but now that workaround is done in Windows only.

3.1.0 (2020-12-18)
------------------

* Files ignored by git are also ignored by fix-format when paths are given explicitly
  in the command-line.

3.0.0 (2020-08-14)
------------------

* Upgrade to ``isort 5``.

2.1.2 (2019-08-26)

2.1.0 (2019-08-09)
------------------

* ``fix-format`` now allows exclude patterns to be configured through ``pyproject.toml``.

2.0.1 (2019-06-26)
------------------

* Fix bug where ``pyproject.toml`` would not be found if a relative path was given in the command-line.

2.0.0 (2019-06-24)
------------------

* ``fix-format`` now only supports Python 3.6+.

* ``fix-format`` can now run `black <https://github.com/python/black>`__ as the
  code formatter for Python code.

  See ``README.rst`` for instructions on how to use it.

* By default ``fix-format`` is now less chatty, showing only files that were/would be changed and a summary
  at the end, unless the new ``--verbose`` flag is given.
